Drowsiness Detection System
Introduction
The Drowsiness Detection System is designed to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers for signs of drowsiness. Utilizing computer vision techniques, the system detects when a driver is becoming drowsy and issues alerts to prevent potential accidents. This application is built using Python, OpenCV, and dlib, leveraging facial landmark detection to monitor eye and mouth states.

Features
The Drowsiness Detection System offers real-time monitoring and alerting. Key features include:

Real-Time Eye Blink Detection: Monitors the frequency and duration of eye blinks to identify signs of drowsiness.
Mouth Yawn Detection: Detects yawning as an indicator of drowsiness.
Alert System: Issues audio or visual alerts when drowsiness is detected.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy setup and use.
Technologies Used
The system leverages the following technologies:

Python: The core programming language used for development.
OpenCV: For real-time video capture and processing.
dlib: For facial landmark detection.
Pygame: For generating audio alerts.
